## How to use

#### Install project:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Run Next.js development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Run Firebase locally for testing:

```
npm run serve
```

#### Deploy it to the cloud with Firebase:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

#### Clean dist folder

```bash
npm run clean
```

## Important

- The empty `placeholder.html` file is so Firebase Hosting does not error on an empty `public/` folder and still hosts at the Firebase project URL.
- `firebase.json` outlines the catchall rewrite rule for our Cloud Function.
- The [Firebase predeploy](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/#predeploy_and_postdeploy_hooks) hooks defined in `firebase.json` will handle linting and compiling of the next app and the functions sourceswhen `firebase deploy` is invoked. The only scripts you should need are `dev`, `clean` and `deploy`.
- Specifying [`"engines": {"node": "8"}`](package.json#L5-L7) in the `package.json` is required for firebase functions
  to be deployed on Node 8 rather than Node 6
  ([Firebase Blog Announcement](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2018/08/cloud-functions-for-firebase-config-node-8-timeout-memory-region.html))
  . This is matched in by specifying target as `es2017` in [`src/functions/tsconfig.json`](src/functions/tsconfig) so that typescript output somewhat compacter and moderner code.
